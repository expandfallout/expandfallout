	Giant Ant.

	GENERATED from Phoenix's `libs/races/ants/sh_race_giantant.lua`.
	Re-run `_docs/tools/genraces.py` rather than editing.

	NOT CARRIED ACROSS - these are function fields whose bodies
	call `nut.` APIs this schema does not have, and a function
	that fails when somebody triggers it is worse than one that
	is absent:

	    OnSpawn
	    OnDeath
	    OnThink
	    OnMelee
	    OnLand
	    OnFootStep

	The animation class for this race's model.

	Without it the race falls back to Half-Life 2 player
	animations, which is a character standing with its arms out,
	sliding rather than walking. The SET itself is in
	`libs/sh_raceanims.lua`, which loads first - several races
	share one, and a table defined in a sibling race file would
	make this depend on alphabetical load order.
