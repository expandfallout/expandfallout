	THE ARRAY FORM MATTERS. Phoenix write this as a keyed table:

	    FACTION.models = { ["models/..."] = true }

	and Helix's `ix.faction.LoadFromDir` iterates with `pairs` and
	precaches the VALUE. Fed `true` it silently skips precaching and
	character creation breaks with no error at all.

	The icon, from `phoenix_faction_icons`.

	Their file names do not match our faction ids - the pack has
	`creature`, `outcast` and `gk` where we have `creatures`,
	`outcasts` and `greatkhans` - so the generator maps the ones
	that differ. A faction with nothing suitable in the pack gets
	one of their numbered defaults rather than naming a material
	that does not exist, which draws as a purple checkerboard.
